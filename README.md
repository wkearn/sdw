# sdw: a sonar data workbench

sdw is an experimental platform for a model-based approach to working with geospatial data. It is focused primarily on sidescan sonar data, which poses a set of interesting challenges for this approach.

sdw is in a state of heavy flux and should be considered highly experimental until the release of version 1.0.0.
